# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software in a detailed-oriented way. I approach the design process by first gathering all requirements and planning out each task that is necessary. Additionally, I set a timeline for completion plan for everything to reference throughout the project and meet deadlines.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Since beginning this project, I was entirely new to OpenGL, I was able to tone up my C++ programming skills and allow myself to become more profient in OpenGL library usage.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a detailed design process of writing up the schematics for the given scene prior to working on it. I also found inspirational images to work off of and compare to my 3D scene. My goal was to create a realistic cabin in the woods scene during the evening time. 

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I believe that my design approach can be replicated in future works due to the relevant skill of comparing and using other successful works as inspiration to grow off of. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by in a detail-oriented, customer-based method. I believe it is important to gather all requirements first, and ensure there is a common understanding with the customer and needs of the program capabilities itself. 

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A development strategy I used when working on the 3D scene was ensuring I had good time management. There were various times within the process where I ran into errors or issues and it took longer than expected to complete a portion. I believe that maintaining realistic time management and personal deadlines are essential to a successful project development.

# How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a factor into the XYZ coordination side of the development process with the shapes. I had to create frequent running iterations of the process and then adjust the coordinates for shape placement as necessary. 

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach to developing code within the project milestones evolved by gaining a better understanding of the libraries being used, as well as building more comfortability in revising the specific files necessary to edit, even those outside of the module guides instructions.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My future goal is to become a fullstack software engineer. I believe that by studying computer science, it will provide me with a strong foundational knowledge base to successfully pursue the career. 

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I believe that comp. graphics and visualizations can help be applied to future educational endeavors if I choose to pursue a graduate degree in the subject. Additionally, the skills I gained may come in handy in future computer science courses I may need. 

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The comp. graphics and visualizations knowledge I learned could be useful and applied to my future professional growth by providing a feel into how creating video games would work. By working and creating graphics, it could help as a stepping stone into graphics and a gaming industry profession.
